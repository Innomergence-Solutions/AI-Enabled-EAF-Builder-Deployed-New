22-1989 - CSRD EOC Activation Freshet,2022-06-15,"Requesting: Geotechnical analysis in Sicamous and Wiseman Creek 
As is the case with Hummingbird Creek, The Shuswap Emergency Program (SEP) has been made aware of a significant change in
volume, colour, and consistency of the Sicamous Creek and Wiseman Creek through the night in Sicamous BC. Residents are reporting
that the creeks has changed from the colour of weak tea yesterday to solid brown this morning with an significant increase of volume and
intensity. The Fire Chief in Sicamous has further reported hearing boulders moving in the Sicamous Creek yesterday. 
Sicamous and Wiseman creeks are highly susceptible to debris flow/flood. Sicamous Creek is consistently at risk of Debris Flow/Flood
according to a geotechnical risk analysis of the watershed, and Wiseman Creek is vulnerable to debris flow due to the post wildfire
conditions resulting from the Two Mile Road Fire (2021). If a Debris flow or severe debris flood were to occur in these watersheds there
would be a high potential for loss of life. 
SEP has hired a geotechnical engineer to assess a very similar situation in Hummingbird Creek and staff are there today conducting their
assessment. Wiseman Creek and Sicamous Creek are the next two creek draws to the North of Hummingbird Creek and originate in the
same general area. While engineers are in the area for Hummingbird Creek, SEP is requesting funding to cover the cost of a geotechnical
analysis in Sicamous and Wiseman Creek to determine the current risk followed by a brief report on the findings. The analysis will require
one day of ground level fieldwork for two geotechnical engineers.",8000.0,8500.0,8500.0,Request for geotechnical analysis related to safety concerns.

Township of Spallumcheen, City of Armstrong and City of Enderby. 
The CSRD EOC was activated in August of this year in response to the Hullcar Mountain fire. This fire was a multi-jurisdictional fire
impacting Splatsin First Nations and the Township of Spallumcheen resulting in evacuation orders affecting all three jurisdictions.
As in any multi-jurisdiction event, coordination and communication could be improved. To secure the Order areas, no thru-traffic
restrictions were required for two main roadways. The CSRD established a permitting process for local traffic traveling south on the Deep
Creek Road. Spallumcheen had a different permitting process set up for local traffic traveling north on the same road. This proved to be
problematic for residents of both local authorities, along with residents of Splatsin and Armstrong.
Through the Indigenous Engagement process, discussion was held on the benefits of hosting a one-day After-Action review for impacted
jurisdictions to discuss coordination of response efforts, develop a universal permitting process and identify additional areas for
improvement. The AAR will assist in the continual improvement in emergency response communication and collaboration for the efficient
and effective response to future multi-jurisdictional events.

were the frontline care providers that impacted public relied on to provide them with the resources they needed to lessen the stress,
depression, mental health and physical challenges evacuation situations create.
Recognizing the important role and time dedicated by these volunteers during this event, the CSRD recognize the need to ensure that
appropriate support is provided to mitigate any effects volunteers may experience from this unusual and stressful event. The CSRDs
approach will be in three segments. The first stage will be to conduct a 4 hour (in-person) After Action Review. The AAR will also include a
virtual survey providing volunteers an opportunity to privately share their experiences reviewing the response process, identification of
strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement. The second stage will consist of a 4 hour CISM debrief focused on
lessening the impact of the event, normalizing volunteers reactions to the event and encouraging the recovery process. And the final
stage will invite one of our First Nations partners to provide volunteers an opportunity to participate in a healing circle.

On August 12, 2023, BCWS Research Geomorphologist, Gareth Wells, notified the CSRD of several elements that are at risk along the
Lower East side of Adams Lake at McLeod Point and Woolford Point. The observations from Mr. Wells are as follows:
 The watershed above McLeod Point burned extensively and is anticipated to be subject to post-wildfire flooding, debris floods or debris
flow hazards. The stream exiting the watershed appears to be moderately well confined in a draw as viewed from the helicopter, where it
crosses the fan at McLeod Point. The degree of channel confinement should be investigated on the ground here to confirm post-wildfire
events will remain in the existing stream course down to the lake, avoiding any houses. If confinement is insufficient, channel avulsions on
the fan may send water, sediment, and debris towards homes along Rawson Road.
 Woolford Creek is also extensively burned and anticipated to be subject to post-wildfire flooding, debris floods, or debris flows. No clear
channel was visible from the air across the fan. The fan should be assessed on the ground to determine where post-wildfire flood/flow
events will travel and which homes on the fan may be at risk. Channel upgrades may be sought to control post-wildfire events (i.e. flooding
or debris flows), particularly in the spring during freshet. If channel confinement is insufficient, avulsions on the fan may send water,
sediment, and debris towards homes along Rawson Road.

of volunteer work assisting over 900 displaced residents by providing ESS services in an empathetic and caring manner. These volunteers
were the frontline care providers that impacted public relied on to provide them with the resources they needed to lessen the stress,
depression, mental health and physical challenges evacuation situations create.
Recognizing the important role and time dedicated by these volunteers during this event, the CSRD recognize the need to ensure that
appropriate support is provided to mitigate any effects volunteers may experience from this unusual and stressful event. The CSRDs
approach will be in three segments. The first stage will be to conduct a 4 hour (in-person) After Action Review. The AAR will also include a
virtual survey providing volunteers an opportunity to privately share their experiences reviewing the response process, identification of
strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement. The second stage will consist of a 4 hour CISM debrief focused on
lessening the impact of the event, normalizing volunteers reactions to the event and encouraging the recovery process. And the final
stage will invite one of our First Nations partners to provide volunteers an opportunity to participate in a healing circle.

22-1989 - Freshet 2022,2022-06-13,"Recent snow melt and rain has caused the Eagle River to rise significantly and brought with it copious
amounts of large woody debris (trees). The debris continues to pile up against the bridge supports and threatens to damage the structure.
The Eagle River has not yet reached its peak level for this season so the force of debris and water is expected to increase along with the
risk to the structure.
The threatened bridge is a partially completed replacement bridge and asset of the District of Sicamous. Project engineers are concerned
about the increasing stress on this partially completed structure. The engineers have sent the following message to SEP:
ISL has reviewed the photos you sent regarding to the current conditions at the Sicamous Solsqua Bridge which crosses the Eagle River.
We have reviewed the River Forecast Centre Advisory, and find that the Eagle River under a Flood Watch (River levels are rising and will
approach or may exceed bankfull. Flooding of areas adjacent to affected rivers may occur). 
On this basis, and from the current conditions identified in the photos (attached) we find the current conditions pose risk to the public and
environment. As the water levels are expected to rise and flows increase, there is risk the debris will block the inlet to the bridge, reduce
its conveyance capacity and cause potential flooding upstream, and therefore, we recommend that mitigation measures be undertaken. 
Our recommendations is at a minimum:
1. Remove the existing debris from the upstream and downstream locations
2. Remove the existing debris from under the bridge
3. Keep equipment on site and on standby and provide daily inspections of the bridge to monitor and remove any debris that may form
around the bridge.
4. Monitor the water levels to determine when the water level peaks and when it begins to recede.
5. Monitor the Provincial River Forecast Center for updates on the advisories and warnings
As the upcoming snowmelt and mild conditions are expected to increase the water levels in the lake and river over the next few weeks, we
recommend this procedure be followed until the Province has removed the Flood watch condition.

22-1405 - CSRD Wiseman Cr Potential Landslide,2022-06-18,"Moved from ETEAM (Res-095719-252-052622)
A post wildfire hazard assessment was conducted by BGC Engineering on the Wiseman, Sicamous, and Hummingbird Creek watersheds
on November 23, 2021. The findings were presented to SEP and EMBC on November 30 and are as follows:
 There is a significant amount of debris in the Wiseman Creek Watershed that has a 100% likelihood of developing into a debris flow in
the next two years
 The debris flow will most likely be triggered by a rainfall event 
 The severity of the triggering rainfall event will dictate the severity of the debris flow
 The spring freshet is the highest risk time for the debris flow. 
 Directly in the in the flow path of the debris flow is Sicamous Creek Mobile Home Park with 27 units and Hwy 97A. Other properties may
be directly affected, but further study is required to identify those affected properties. 
SEP and the District of Sicamous are working to reduce the risk of the potential debris flow through the winter to prepare for likely
scenarios in the spring. 
SEP has received funding through FLNRORD to implement an early warning system to provide situational awareness of possible rainfall
events that may trigger a debris flow in the Wiseman Creek drainage. After three exceedances of the POSSIBLE rainfall thresholds and
one exceedance of LIKELY, it has become necessary to get advice from BGC engineers on the interpretation of the scientific data being
used in the early warning system to help with decision making. 
SEP is requesting funding approval to cover the costs of scientific interpretations of data provided from the early warning system to
ensure the best possible decision making by emergency managers. These services would be utilized when an exceedance to the
established rainfall thresholds occurs and scientific interpretation is required to make decisions. This fund would be utilized for advice
that is out-of-scope of the original early warning system creation and implementation project.",5000.0,5000.0,5000.0,Request for funds to address landslide or debris-related concerns.
22-1405 - CSRD Wiseman Cr Potential Landslide,2023-04-12,"2023 has been a record setting drought and wildfire year with such low rainfall that no known geotechnical events occurred in Wiseman
Creek. BGC found efficiencies while monitor the risk in 2023 which resulted in significant savings ($35,000 under) over original estimates.
The SEP is hopeful that enough revegetation has occurred since 2021 to reduce the risk of future debris floods and debris flows in
Wiseman Creek. With public safety in mind the SEP is requesting approval to amend this EAF to include a remote sensing review and
report by BGC to confirm the revegetation level is sufficient to reduce the risk in Wiseman Creek and stop the monitoring requirement for
2024 and beyond. The estimate to conduct this review is $15,000 and will not exceed the original requested amount.
Amount requested not changed. 
Original:
The Shuswap Emergency Program (SEP) was notified of a significant risk of debris flow/flood in the 
Sicamous and Wiseman Creeks following the 2021 Two-Mile Road Wildfire. According to a geotechnical 
risk analysis of the watershed, if a debris flow or severe debris flood were to occur in these watersheds
there would be a high potential for loss of life. 
With support from the province SEP hired the geotechnical firm BGC to develop a monitoring system 
that will give advance warning of a significant rainfall event likely to cause a debris flow/flood that would 
impact the residents below Sicamous and Wiseman Creek. SEP is requesting funding to cover the

Due to the immediate post-wildfire geotechnical hazard the CSRD requested a preliminary report from a qualified
professional geotechnical engineer (BGC) to identify areas where the public is at risk. The BGC report was received October
23, 2023 and included recommendations, on page 31, to use the results on an interim basis until a more detailed assessment
is available. The BCWS hired Stantec to conduct a more detailed review of the same area and the report was received
December 20, 2023. The Stantec report includes numerous recommendations, starting on page 40, including more detailed
analysis of areas of Moderate to Very High risk of debris flows, rock fall and clear water flooding.
Freshet is now fast approaching and the real threat to public safety from the identified geohazards is becoming more
imminent.
The CSRD is requesting provincial funding to complete a more detailed analysis of the High to Very High geohazard rating

virtual survey providing volunteers an opportunity to privately share their experiences reviewing the response process, identification of
strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement. The second stage will consist of a 4 hour CISM debrief focused on
lessening the impact of the event, normalizing volunteers reactions to the event and encouraging the recovery process. And the final

- Complete a Needs Assessment Form,
- Connect clients with appropriate agencies and NGOs that can provide support to complete the
recovery and rebuilding process,
- Stay connected with clients in person and/or remotely until their needs are met.
As the needs of clients are met, the demand for case workers will decrease. Case worker hours will be scaled back in a phased approach:
- First month following re-entry: 5 Case Workers plus 1 Team Lead:

A Resiliency Centre has been established by the Resiliency Manager approved in EAF 2023-58 to provide direct support to residents who
have experienced loss due to the wildfire. As the requirement for ESS Reception Centre services diminishes, the need for Resiliency
Centre support service will increase and be an ongoing necessity for up to a year. There are approximately 178 properties with full
structure loss and/or have been deemed unsafe for residents to return. An additional 82 properties with partial structure loss have been
reported.

Manager. Case Workers will assist individuals who experienced total or partial losses from the wildfire in the following ways:
- Greet and build a relationship with clients in person or via telecommunications,
- Complete a Needs Assessment Form,
- Connect clients with appropriate agencies and NGOs that can provide support to complete the
recovery and rebuilding process,

On August 12, 2023, BCWS Research Geomorphologist, Gareth Wells, notified the CSRD of several elements that are at risk along the
Lower East side of Adams Lake at McLeod Point and Woolford Point. The observations from Mr. Wells are as follows:
 The watershed above McLeod Point burned extensively and is anticipated to be subject to post-wildfire flooding, debris floods or debris
flow hazards. The stream exiting the watershed appears to be moderately well confined in a draw as viewed from the helicopter, where it
crosses the fan at McLeod Point. The degree of channel confinement should be investigated on the ground here to confirm post-wildfire
events will remain in the existing stream course down to the lake, avoiding any houses. If confinement is insufficient, channel avulsions on
the fan may send water, sediment, and debris towards homes along Rawson Road.
 Woolford Creek is also extensively burned and anticipated to be subject to post-wildfire flooding, debris floods, or debris flows. No clear
channel was visible from the air across the fan. The fan should be assessed on the ground to determine where post-wildfire flood/flow
events will travel and which homes on the fan may be at risk. Channel upgrades may be sought to control post-wildfire events (i.e. flooding
or debris flows), particularly in the spring during freshet. If channel confinement is insufficient, avulsions on the fan may send water,
sediment, and debris towards homes along Rawson Road.

22-1989 - Freshet 2022,2022-06-13,"Due to 22-1989 - Freshet 2022 at Unknown, Recent snow melt and rain has caused the Eagle River to rise significantly and brought with it copious
amounts of large woody debris (trees). The debris continues to pile up against the bridge supports and threatens to damage the structure.
The Eagle River has not yet reached its peak level for this season so the force of debris and water is expected to increase along with the
risk to the structure.
The threatened bridge is a partially completed replacement bridge and asset of the District of Sicamous. Project engineers are concerned
about the increasing stress on this partially completed structure. The engineers have sent the following message to SEP:

approach or may exceed bankfull. Flooding of areas adjacent to affected rivers may occur). 
On this basis, and from the current conditions identified in the photos (attached) we find the current conditions pose risk to the public and
environment. As the water levels are expected to rise and flows increase, there is risk the debris will block the inlet to the bridge, reduce
its conveyance capacity and cause potential flooding upstream, and therefore, we recommend that mitigation measures be undertaken. 
Our recommendations is at a minimum:

outflows of their storm water system to ensure that lake water does not backflow into their downtown core. This system drains the bulk of
the downtown Sicamous core. The District has purchased three pumps which were being used to pump out any water that has been
accumulating as a result of the blocked outflows. However the Sicamous area received a significant amount of rainfall yesterday and
further rain is forecasted over the next few days. One of three pumps owned by the District has gone down and the two remaining pumps
cannot keep up with the volume of water. In addition, the amount of precipitation the Sicamous area is receiving is above the normal
